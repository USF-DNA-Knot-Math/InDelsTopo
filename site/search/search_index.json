It implements the Insertion Chain Complex introduced in Natasha Jonoska, Francisco Martinez-Figueroa, and Masahico Saito, The Insertion Chain Complex: A Topological Approach to the Structure of Word Sets , 2025. Overview The Insertion Chain Complex framework provides a topological structure on the relationships between words that differ by insertions and deletions. It was originally developed to model DNA sequence variation during double-strand break repair but can be applied to any setting where the structure of sets of words needs to be analyzed. InDelsTopo provides: Construction of Filtrations and Complexes over word sets Tools to compute homology , Euler characteristic curves , and persistent homology Optional integration with SageMath Methods to analyze and visualize the topological structure of word sets Installation Install via pip: pip install InDelsTopo For full functionality (e.g., integer homology over $\\mathbb{Z}$), install SageMath and run your notebooks in a SageMath kernel.
