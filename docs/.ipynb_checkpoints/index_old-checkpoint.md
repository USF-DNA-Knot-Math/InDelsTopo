# InDelsTopo 
A Python package to analyze topological properties of sets of words when their main source of variation are insertions and deletions, using the Insertion Chain Complex framework.

## Introduction

**InDelsTopo** implements the **Insertion Chain Complex** framework (Jonoska, Martinez-Figueroa, and Saito, [arXiv:2509.12607](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12607)), originally developed to analyze variation in collections of DNA sequences following double-strand break repair. 

The package enables general analysis of word sets where **insertions and deletions** are the primary source of variation, using topological tools such as **persistent homology** and **Euler characteristic curves**.
