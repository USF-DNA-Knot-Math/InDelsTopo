# InDelsTopo

**InDelsTopo** is a Python package for studying the **topological structure of sets of words**,  especially when their primary source of variation arises from **insertions and deletions**.  

It implements the **Insertion Chain Complex** introduced in

## Overview

The Insertion Chain Complex framework provides a **topological structure** on the relationships between words that differ by insertions and deletions.  
It was originally developed to model **DNA sequence variation** during double-strand break repair but can be applied to any setting where the structure of sets of words needs to be analyzed. 

**InDelsTopo** provides:

- Construction of **Filtrations** and **Complexes** over word sets  
- Tools to compute **homology**, **Euler characteristic curves**, and **persistent homology**  
- Optional integration with **SageMath**  
- Methods to analyze and visualize the **topological structure** of word sets

## Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install InDelsTopo
```

For full functionality (e.g., integer homology over $\mathbb{Z}$), install [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) and run your notebooks in a SageMath kernel.

## Quick Start

```python
from InDelsTopo import Filtration, filtration_plot

# Create a filtration from a small set of words
F = Filtration()
F.compute_d_skeleton(['a', 'b', 'ab', '', 'ba'], [1,2,3,4,5])

# Visualize the sublevel sets at different heights. 
F.get_graph(1)
F.get_graph(2)
F.get_graph(5)
```

## Main Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Block** | Represents a combinatorial element generated by insertions. |
| **Chain** | Linear combination of blocks with integer coefficients. |
| **Complex** | Collection of blocks and faces forming a topological structure. |
| **Filtration** | Sequence of nested complexes indexed by a height function. |
